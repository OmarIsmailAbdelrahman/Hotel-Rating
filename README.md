Hotel rating prediction is a project that aimed to predict the rating of hotels based on different features like location, amenities, and services. 
The project included extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, extract meaningful features, and encode categorical data. 
Exploratory data analysis was also conducted using graphs and plots to better understand the relationship between different variables.
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. 
The best performing model was a random forest with an accuracy of 86%, which was able to successfully predict hotel ratings based on the input features.
The project also involved feature importance analysis to identify the most important features that contribute to hotel ratings. 
Overall, this project showcases the use of machine learning in predicting hotel ratings and can be applied in the hospitality industry 
to provide insights and improve the quality of service.
